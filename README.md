# Streetcar
Streetcar is a game about streetcars
'''
you are a streetcar person tasked with setting up cable car tracks and trains 
while earning enough money to expand your streetcar service on to other cities.
-you must find the most optimal path to lay each cable car track, accounting for:

        >need for a street car service on this route (number of riders)

        >price per ride (riders will not want to ride if the price is too expensive. 
            streetcars will require more maintenance with more rides and more riders.)

        >number of, quality of, price of maintenance for streetcars.

        >worker wages

        >conflicting routes between trains, buses, and street cars.

        >broken street cars.
